I am a computer scientist, game designer, and educator who loves to make things that are fun, challenging, and useful.

My work includes games, applications, hardware, programming languages, data visualizations, websites, and more. If it’s original, meaningful, and I get to make it with my own hands, I’m into it. A strong believer that open source is the best way to write software, I [share](http://github.com/nasser) as much of my work as I can.

Behind my passion is a B.S. in Computer Science from the [American University of Beirut](http://www.aub.edu.lb/), an M.F.A. in Design and Technology from [Parsons The New School for Design](http://parsons.edu), an [Eyebeam Fellowship](http://eyebeam.org/people/ramsey-nasser) and almost a decade of professional experience. At my side are the [most](http://kahoabe.net/) [talented](http://timsgardner.com/) [artists](https://twitter.com/kurrrt) [and](http://berg.industries/) [designers](http://stfj.net) this side of the Atlantic, who I am honored to call my friends and collaborators.

The photo is of me [giving talk at Strange Loop 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr_TD1BtF0) on [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/) with [Tims Gardner](http://timsgardner.com/). It was taken by [Mike Bridge](https://twitter.com/michaelbridge).

When I have time, I’m open to take on interesting new projects, so [get in touch](mailto: ramseynasser@fastmail.com) if you’re working on something that could use my skill set. Or just to say hello. I always have time to say hello.
