[Handväska!](https://nasser.itch.io/handvaska) is an over-the-top, super-fast, physics-based, antifascist first person shooter (or first purse-on shooter). Players have 15 seconds to smash as many fascists with their purse as possible and send them bouncing off of buildings and clouds like pinballs in a pinball machine. Handväska! was developed using [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/) in collaboration with [Jane Friedhoff](http://janefriedhoff.com/) for the [2017 Global Game Jam in Brooklyn](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/jam-sites/nyu-game-center). It is available [on itch.io](https://nasser.itch.io/handvaska) as a pay-what-you-want download with all proceeds going to anti-hate organizations. Handväska! won "Best use of Politics" at the game jam and was featured by [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/27/14418720/nazi-punching-video-game), [Autostraddle](https://www.autostraddle.com/handvaska-for-when-you-just-need-to-hit-some-virtual-nazis-with-a-purse-367938/), [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/a-game-where-you-go-bowling-for-fascists-1792139419), [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/want-to-smash-nazis-with-handbags-theres-a-game-for-that), and [A.V. Club](http://www.avclub.com/article/here-come-more-video-games-about-punching-nazis-an-249983), among others.

The premise comes from the 1985 [Hans Runesson](http://www.hansrunesson.se/) photo *A Woman Hitting a Neo-Nazi With Her Handbag* which captures the moment before Danuta Danielsson's handbag connects with a Nordic Reich Party member's head while marching in Växjö, Sweden, as well as the well documented physical assault of white supremacist Richard Spencer. Taking from Jane's [*Playing With Resistance*](https://medium.com/@jfriedhoff/playing-with-resistance-a483b19d4fe7) essay, Handväska!'s goal is to be a power fantasy for those who feel powerless in the face of rising fascism.
