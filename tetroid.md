Tetroid is a Tetris clone implemented on an [Arduino Duemilanove](http://www.arduino.cc/) and a severely misused [Parallax 4x20 LCD screen](http://www.parallax.com/Store/Accessories/Displays/tabid/159/List/1/ProductID/51/Default.aspx). Three physical buttons act as rotate, left and right controls. It was completed for [Joel Murphy](http://www.joelmurphy.net/)â€™s Physical Computing class at Parsons The New School for Design. Tetroid is written in C.
