The لا shirt is a t-shirt with the Arabic word لا ("no") in large type across the wearer's body. Wearing it loudly rejects fascism and islamophobia by making the Arabic language more visible in public spaces and by literally saying "no". It is available on teespring in [black](https://teespring.com/the-no-shirt-black) and [white](https://teespring.com/the-no-shirt) and all profits go to the ACLU.
