[Frankenstein AI](http://frankenstein.ai/) was a large-scale immersive and interactive theater piece shown at the Sundance film festival. I collaborated with [Kaho Abe](https://kahoabe.net/) to develop a magical Ouija board-style controller used by the audience. The planchettes were fabricated by Kaho and designed to interact with the touchscreen computer running the controller experience. It was developed in JavaScript and Electron.
