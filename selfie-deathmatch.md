Selfie Deathmatch is a two person competitive physical selfie stick game where players compete to take the best selfie within a time period. The main screen was built in JavaScript using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and the software running on the phones was written in Java using the Android SDK. Selfie Deathmatch was a collaboration with [Kaho Abe](https://kahoabe.net/) who designed and fabricated the judge controls.

The selfie with the most faces wins the round, and players jostle to get as much of the audience into their selfie as possible while messing up their opponent's shot. The photos are then tweeted to the [Eternal Leader Board](https://twitter.com/selfiedm), and the number of likes and retweets each selfie gets adds to its base score.

Selfie Deathmatch was supported by and showcased at [CultureHub](https://www.culturehub.org).
