[Syntax Canvas][2] is a rapid prototyping tool for language designers. It is implemented as a client-side application in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using CodeMirror, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

It allows a language designer to mock up syntax highlighting for a language in development to get an idea of what it would look and feel like as a finished language. Languages are stored locally in your browser. The syntax grammar is very light, and all edits are live.
