[Dialogue 3-D](https://nasser.itch.io/dialogue-3-d) is a mod of [Wolfenstein 3-D](http://3d.wolfenstein.com/) where a dialog box prompts players with ethical questions about violence against Nazis whenever they try to attack. The fact that the Nazis continue to attack while the dialog box is open renders the game generally unplayable. It was developed in JavaScript based on [id Software's open source port](https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d-browser) and uses their original art. Dialogue 3-D was featured on [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-parody-thoughtfully-examines-the-ethics-of-1792061280), [Waypoint](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/be-your-own-devils-advocate-in-this-free-nazi-shooter?utm_source=vicefbus), [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/wolfenstein-3d-remix-lets-you-try-to-talk-to-the-nazis/?utm_content=buffer529d8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=buffer_pcgamerfb), [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/07/wolfenstein-parody-shooting-nazis/), [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/7/14534862/wolfenstein-nazi-talk-mod-richard-spencer), [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/6/14524866/wolfenstein-dialogue-3-d-nazi-punching-debate-ramsey-nasser), and [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/someone-modded-wolfenstein-3d-to-ask-if-violence-against-nazis-is-okay) among others.
